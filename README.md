# Supply-Chain-Analysis
A business intelligence project focused on supply chain optimization, order fulfilment rates, and city-wise demand trends using Power BI.

## Problem statement
AtliQ Mart is a growing FMCG manufacturer headquartered in Gujarat, India. It is currently operational in three cities Surat, Ahmedabad and Vadodra. They want to expand to other metro/tier 1 cities in the next 2 years.

AtliQ Mart is facing a problem where a few key customers did not extend their annual contracts due to service issues. It is speculated that some essential products were either not delivered on time or not delivered in full over a continued period, which could have resulted in bad customer service. Management wants to fix this issue before expanding to other cities and requested their supply chain analytics team to track the ’On time’ and ‘In Full’ delivery service level for all the customers daily so that they can respond swiftly to these issues.

The Supply Chain team decided to use a standard approach to measure the service level in which they will measure ‘on-time delivery (OT) %’, ‘In-full delivery (IF) %’ and OnTime in full (OTIF) % of the customer orders daily against the target service level set for each customer.
